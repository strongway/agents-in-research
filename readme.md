# AI-Assisted Psychological Research: Tutorial & Presentation

This repository contains a **complete tutorial presentation** demonstrating how AI agents can accelerate psychological research workflows, from experiment design through data analysis to manuscript composition.

## What's Inside

This is a **hands-on tutorial** for researchers at LMU Munich, including:

- **Presentation slides** (`slides.md`) - Slidev-based presentation covering the complete workflow
- **Working examples** - Complete implementations of each workflow stage
- **AI agent instructions** (`CLAUDE.md`, `agents.md`) - Configuration for AI coding assistants

**Reference Study**: [Bocheva & Rahnev (2025)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40775585/) orientation discrimination task with confidence ratings (Choosing this study is simply I came across it recently; no affiliation).

## The 5-Stage Workflow (Demonstrated)

### Stage 1: Experiment Development
**Example**: `psychopy/study.psyexp` (built from skeleton)
- PsychoPy Builder experiment implementing the full paradigm
- Gabor stimuli with precise timing and response collection
- Demonstrates AI editing XML-based .psyexp files

### Stage 2: Data Collection
**Example**: `study/Raw_Data/` (from [OSF](https://osf.io/yns96/files))
- 45 participants (Exp 1), 51 participants (Exp 2)
- 1000 trials per participant
- CSV format with confidence ratings and response times

### Stage 3: Data Analysis
**Example**: `study/analysis/analysis_v1.py` and `analysis_v2.qmd`
- Serial dependence regression analysis
- Publication-quality figures
- Complete statistical reporting
- Demonstrates Python → R/Quarto conversion

### Stage 4: Critical Review & Iteration
**Example**: `study/analysis/REVIEW.md`
- Professional review of v1 analysis
- Categorized improvement suggestions (critical/important/minor)
- Iterative improvement workflow (v1 → review → v2)
- Demonstrates AI self-review capabilities

### Stage 5: Manuscript Writing (not included here)
**Example**: `study/manuscript/*.md`
- Literature synthesis workflow (using NotebookLM)
- Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion sections
- Story-driven narrative (not stats-driven)
- Demonstrates human-AI collaboration in academic writing

## Running the Presentation


```bash
slidev slides.md
```

## Using This Tutorial

### For Presentation Attendees
1. Browse the examples in each stage folder
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` to understand AI agent instructions
3. Try modifying examples with AI coding assistants
4. Explore the iterative review workflow (v1 → v2)

### For AI Agents
If you're an AI assistant helping with this project:
1. **Primary instructions**: Read `CLAUDE.md` first
2. **Alternative format**: See `agents.md` for task-oriented guide
3. **Context**: This is a teaching demonstration, not active research
4. **Goal**: Show how AI accelerates research while maintaining rigor

### For Researchers Adapting This Workflow
1. Use the PsychoPy example as template for your experiments
2. Follow the review workflow (v1 → REVIEW.md → v2) for quality control
3. Use the manuscript writing prompts for your papers

## Key Learning Points

**Human-AI Collaboration Principles**:
- ✅ AI handles execution (coding, formatting, drafting)
- ✅ Humans handle thinking (design, review, decisions)
- ✅ Iterative improvement cycles maintain quality
- ✅ Complete transparency and reproducibility

**Time Savings** (from presentation):
- Experiment coding: 2-3 hours → 15 minutes
- Data analysis: 2-3 days → 40 minutes
- Manuscript drafting: 2-3 weeks → 12 hours (with deep review)
- **Total**: 5-6 weeks → ~15 hours human time + 90 min AI time

**Quality Maintained**:
- Version control (v1/v2 preserved)
- Review documentation (REVIEW.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- Reproducible code with clear comments
- Academic standards upheld (APA format, proper statistics)
